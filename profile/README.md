## Welcome !

Here is where we collaborate with the greater open source community to help bring better software to the world. 
Our main projects consist of web based applications backed by JavaScript or Typescript, with an emphasis on financial technology. 
Our open source projects consist of anything, so long as it inspires creativity and positive collaboration.
We love tinkering with programming, and invite you to help build some amazing projects with us!ðŸ˜Š
